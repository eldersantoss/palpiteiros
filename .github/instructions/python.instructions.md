# Python Coding Conventions

## Python Instructions

- Write clear and concise comments for each function.
- Ensure functions have descriptive names and include type hints.
- Provide docstrings following PEP 257 conventions.
- Prefer built-in types (e.g., `list[str]`, `dict[str, int]`, `int | None`) instead of those provided by the typing module.
  - Use the `typing` module if it's not possible to use built-int types, such as in advanced cases.
- Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions.

## General Instructions

- Always prioritize readability and clarity.
- For algorithm-related code, include explanations of the approach used.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments.
- Use consistent naming conventions and follow language-specific best practices.
- Write concise, efficient, and idiomatic code that is also easily understandable.

## Code Style and Formatting

- Follow the **PEP 8** style guide for Python.
- Maintain proper indentation (use 4 spaces for each level of indentation).
- Ensure lines do not exceed 120 characters.
- Place function and class docstrings immediately after the `def` or `class` keyword.
- Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and code blocks where appropriate.

## Edge Cases and Testing

- Always include test cases for critical paths of the application.
- Account for common edge cases like empty inputs, invalid data types, and large datasets.
- Include comments for edge cases and the expected behavior in those cases.
- Write unit tests for functions and document them with docstrings explaining the test cases.
